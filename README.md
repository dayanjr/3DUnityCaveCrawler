## Cave Crawler Game
# Overview
A simple yet fun dungeon crawler type game. Fight monsters, loot chests, and try to make it to the end of each level without perishing! The levels are 
randomly generated, guaranteeing a new experience every time! Enjoy numerous original 3d models, sounds, and scripts, and concepts.

The goal of this work is not to be a fully functioning game, but a short and simple project made by a few people wanting to grow their abilities in 
the world of game development, programming, and 3d modeling. The complete game is not included in this repository. The scripts and models are the only things included here.
